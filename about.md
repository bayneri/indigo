Hi! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èI'm Halil Cetiner, rarely known as [_bayneri_](https://www.twitter.com/bayneri).

I'm a Senior Software Engineer currently living in London. I moved here back in February 2020, just before _you-know-who_ hit this part of the world. Before that, I spent almost the entirety of my life in a lovely but chaotic city, my hometown, Istanbul.

I'm currently working at [Meta](https://about.facebook.com/) as a Software Engineer. Currently, I am focused on developing a scalable and rapid experimentation platform for Commerce and Shops Ads teams at Meta.

Before joining Meta, I used to work at Yelp on a new generation logging and streaming data pipeline, delivering up to 1M events/second into Apache Kafka across multiple data centers.

Previously I worked at various sizes of startups. If you are interested in the details, please visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cetinerhalil).

## A little bit of a backstory

I started coding when I was 13 years old with C and C++ for the competitive programming club in my high school. My competitive programming journey was not a total success story but I was poisoned with the love of the bare-metal box (_That was a bit poetic, huh?_). I kept learning new skills since the first `Hello, world!` code block. 
I started working part-time in my sophomore year at the university and have been working at different companies since then.

After floating around different parts of the product development, I got attracted by the dark side. In the last few years, I grew an interest in distributed systems, streaming and data platforms. Besides my daily job, I've been reading, watching, and building a lot to deepen my knowledge in those areas. Lockdowns did help me to find time to do all of that üôÉ
