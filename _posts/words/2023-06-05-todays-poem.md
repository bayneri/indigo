<p>
Today,<br>
I started writing a book.<br>
A book about everything,<br>
and nothing.<br>
A book to tell about me,<br>
and to hide my true self.<br>
A piece of art,<br>
and a collection of bullshit.<br>
Everything, all at once.<br>
<br>
Today,<br>
I woke up to change the world.<br>
<br>
Yesterday,<br>
I was a fool<br>
trying to become a better person.<br>
Today,<br>
Iâ€™m a hero,<br><br>
Changing the world
for better<br>
&nbsp;or worse.<br>
<br>
Today,<br>
I decided to write a book<br>
to achieve this humble goal.<br>
Why bother changing myself,<br>
when I can change the world.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow,<br>
I might quit writing<br>
or quit my day job.<br>
At the very least,<br>
I can always quit quitting<br>
to quench my insatiable longing<br>
to quit something.<br>
<br>
Today,<br>
I wrote a poem<br>
about writing a book,<br>
and changing the world,<br>
and my desires.<br>
A poem,<br>
about yesterday,<br>
tomorrow,<br>
and of course,<br>
today.<br>
</p>
